# Django Blog Application

A feature-rich, modern blog platform built with Django. This application supports user registration, profile management, post creation, tagging, comments (with threaded replies), likes, bookmarks, and email subscriptions. It is designed for easy deployment and extensibility.

## Data Model Overview

- **User**: Djangoâ€™s built-in user model for authentication and authoring content.
- **Profile**: Extends User with avatar, bio, and a unique slug.
- **Post**: Blog post with title, content, image, tags, author, likes, bookmarks, and view count.
- **Tag**: Categorizes posts for easier navigation and filtering.
- **Comment**: Supports threaded replies, linked to posts and optionally users.
- **Subscribe**: Stores email subscriptions for blog updates.
- **WebsiteMeta**: Stores site-wide metadata (title, description, about).

- Each `Post` is authored by a `User` and can have multiple `Tags` (many-to-many).

- Users can like and bookmark multiple posts (many-to-many).
